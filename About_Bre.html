        <h3>About Bre</h3>
        
        <p>I'm Bre and this is my dog Hyrum. I'm 18 and currently I paint houses for a living. 
           I love music and playing guitar. I also love dogs. 
           I've always wanted a big dog and finally just a couple months ago I rescued Hyrum. 
           I love to be outside and go hiking and swimming. I also love to travel and go on spontaneous adventures.
           I was born in South Korea and was adopted when I was 6 months old. I have one brother named Kyle who is a year younger than me.
           I love watching and playing football as well as basketball.
           I've lived in Traverse City my whole life and now I'm incredibly excited to get out of here and see what the rest of the world has to offer.
        </p>
